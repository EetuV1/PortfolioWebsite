## My Portfolio Website

Fun and quick React project. Adding a video background is a easy way to make a website look fancier, in my opinion. However, it doesn't work on phones... There is this "feature" that I haven't yet fixed; sometimes it starts to play the background video on full screen with phones...

### Deployment

I used Netlify for deployment. It is easy to make updates to the site when you only have to push the changes to GitHub. It's also free with up to 100 GB bandwidth per month, except, of course, for the custom domain name.
